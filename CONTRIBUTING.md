# 📜 Contributing Guidelines

## Branch Strategy

Never push directly to `main`.

```text
main
├── frontend
└── backend
```

### Backend Branches

```text
backend/auth
backend/product
backend/rental
backend/payment
backend/dashboard
```

### Frontend Branches

```text
frontend/auth
frontend/product
frontend/rental
frontend/dashboard
```

Merge only after both teammates verify the feature works.

## Critical Advice

From **10:45 AM to 7:00 AM**, focus on getting a complete, working rental lifecycle rather than perfecting individual pages. A polished end-to-end demo—**Login → Browse → Book → Pay → Pickup → Return → Dashboard**—will make a much stronger impression on judges than many incomplete features. Keep `main` deployable, push code frequently, and avoid starting new modules until the current workflow is integrated and functioning.
